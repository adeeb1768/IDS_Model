The ever-increasing reliance of various systems on internet infrastructure necessitates the continuous
development of intelligent protection schemes to combat the escalating cyber threat landscape.
This research explores the potential of federated learning for training Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDS). We propose a model that leverages the Flower framework and deep learning techniques
to achieve signfiicant improvements. Using the CIC IoT 2023 dataset, our model demonstrates
exceptional accuracy (around 98 .5%) while minimizing loss (around 6 .7%). Additionally, it
achieves optimal False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) values, enabling
effective detection of 11 distinct cyberattacks and normal data flow.
